@article{Cortina:2010p8800,
author = {Mauricio Cortina}, 
journal = {Psychiatry},
title = {The future of psychodynamic psychotherapy},
abstract = {The article reviews the current state and future of psychodynamic psychotherapies. In the past few decades psychodynamic psychotherapies have fallen into disrepute due to the fractious and dogmatic nature of different psychodynamic schools of thought and the lack of interest in validating some of its major premises or its effectiveness in comparison with other psychotherapy modalities. Despite these self-inflicted wounds, psychodynamic theory and treatment is staging a comeback. Many of the major premises that comprise the complex, layered model of the mind that are the basis of psychodynamic treatments have again begun to be validated. A list of basic psychodynamic concepts is described. The evidence for each of these concepts varies, but as a whole the evidence is broad and deep for the model of the mind posited by psychoanalysis. This evidence is coming from many fields of knowledge that are not necessarily influenced by psychoanalysis. There have also been significant advances in developing methods and tools that can probe systematically into the complex nature of psychodynamic treatment processes. Finally, statistical tools-such as meta-analytic studies-that can aggregate and compare many different studies at once are beginning to show the effectiveness of dynamic psychotherapies in comparison with other modalities of treatment.},

title = {Controlling core knowledge: Conditions for the ascription of intentional states to self and others by children},
abstract = {Abstract	The ascription of intentional states to the self involves knowledge, or at least claims to knowledge. Armed with the working definition of knowledge as `the ability to do things, or refrain from doing things, or believe, or want, or doubt things, for reasons that are facts' [Hyman, J. Philos. Quart. 49:432--451], I sketch a simple competence model of acting and believing from knowledge and when knowledge is defeated by un-experienced changes of state. The model takes the form of three concen- tric circles. The `periphery' is analogous to Fodor's [(1983), The modularity of mind. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA] input systems. The `core' contains copies of peripheral representations, and between these representations there is executive competition. At the `nucleus', operations are performed on the core representations of, at least, nega- tion and recursion. I argue that this provides a fruitful way in which to conceptualise why theory-of-mind tasks challenge pre-school children, how some degree of first- person authority is mental state attribution is possible, and how executive inhibition is achieved.},

title = {Is Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic edifice relevant to the 21st century},
abstract = {To warrant the relevance, if any, of Freud's psychoanalytic edifice to the 21st century, its supporters must endeavor, if at all possible, to find genuine evidence for its major pillars or to modify them significantly in response to emerging new evidence. Such a quest must begin with a clear understanding of the range and depth of the failure of Freud's cardinal clinical arguments. I endeavor below to provide such comprehension by laying bare the epistemological gravamen in the case of each of his principal tenets. And I argue that neither the post-Freudian formulations of psychoanalysis nor its so-called ``hermeneutic'' reconstruction has succeeded in vindicating the psychoanalytic enterprise.},
annote = {Discussion of various criticisms Gr{\"u}nbaum has raised and the replies they have generated.
" By invoking the alleged causal cogency of the method of free association as a warrant for his compromise model, he generated a pseudo-unification of neurotic behavior with dreaming and the bungling of actions. This dubious unification was effected by conceiving of the normal activities of dreaming and occasionally bungling actions as mini-neurotic symptoms, of a piece with abnormal mentation in neuroses and even psychoses. " (277)

This seems a relevant bit.},

title = {What Makes Representational Painting Truly Visual?},
abstract = {[Richard Wollheim] Any experiential view of pictorial meaning will assign to each painting an appropriate experience through which its mean can be recovered. When the meaning is representational, what is the nature of the appropriate experience? If there is agreement that the experience is to be described as seeing-in, disagreement breaks out about how seeing-in is to be understood. This paper challenges two recent interpretations: one in terms of perceived resemblance, the other in terms of imagining seeing. Neither view gives a correct account of how the spectator distributes his attention between the marked surface and the represented object. /// [Robert Hopkins] I offer two, complementary, accounts of the visual nature of representational picturing. One, in terms of six features of depiction, sets an explanatory task. The other, in terms of the experience to which depiction gives rise, promises to meet that need. Elsewhere I have offered an account of this experience that allows this promise to be fulfilled. I sketch that view, and defend it against Wollheim's claim that it cannot meet certain demands on a satisfactory account. I then turn to Wollheim's own view, arguing that it suffers from crucial obscurities. These prevent it from meeting the explanatory commitments I describe, and are only exacerbated by the demands Wollheim himself imposes.},

In so doing, I aim to make explicit the role that seeing empty space has, implicitly, in Mike Martin's account of the visual field. I suggest we should make sense of the claim that vision has a field---in Martin'ss sense---in terms of our being aware of its limitations or boundaries. I argue that the limits of the visual field are our own sensory limitations, and that we are aware of them as such. Seeing empty space, I argue, involves a structural feature of experience that constitutes our awareness of our visual sensory limitations, and thus, in virtue of which vision has a field.},

journal = {International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music},
title = {The Elements of Expression in Music: A Psychological View / Element Ekspresije u Glazbi: Psihologijsko Stajali{\v s}te},
abstract = {Hanslick recognized the importance of the new auditory sciences of physiology and psychology for the study of feelings in music; but, in the auditory science of his day, he found no explanation of emotions within the complex art of music. A concept of the emotions given by William James in 1890 opened new possibilities. The so-called James-Lange theory proposed that emotions started in the motions and tensions of the body and were only later felt by the brain. Donald N. Ferguson in 1922 recognized the similarity of music's elements of motion and tension to the bodily ones. He put forth a theory that music of great composers could represent, by its elements, an emotion or complex of emotions that humans feel. Two examples of Bach fugue subjects show his method. Reference is made to recent psychological studies /// Godine 1853. i kasnije Hanslick je priznao va{\v z}nost koju su nove znanosti fiziologije i psihologije sluha mogle imati za glazbu. Istra{\v z}ivao je obja{\^s}njenje koje su one mogle dati za »emocije» ili osje{\'c}aje u glazbi. Zaklju{\v c}io je da - premda ove znanosti mogu objasniti proizvodnju, prijenos i dolazak vibracija na pu{\v z}nicu uha te njihov ulazak u {\v z}iv{\v c}ani sustav - one ne mogu objasniti slo{\v z}enu umjetnost glazbe. Godine 1890. William Jones iznio je novu ideju o emocijama, poznatu kao James-Lange teoriju. On po{\v c}etak emocija nije smjestio u mozak, nego u napetost i motori{\v c}ke impulse mi{\v s}i{\'c}{\^a}, udova, organ{\^a} osjeta i unutarnjih organa, odnosno tjelesnih napetosti i akcija koje je mozak osje{\'c}ao sa sna {\v z}nim posljedicama. Godine 1922. Donald N. Ferguson prou{\v c}io je Jamesovo djelo Principles of Psychology (Na{\v c}ela psihologije) i iznio teoriju da glazba ima elemente glazbenih napetosti i ritmova koji su paralelni s tjelesnima, te koje se pomo{\'c}u tih elemenata mo{\v z}e dovesti u vezu s bilo kojom emocijom ili kompleksom emocija. Prona{\v s}ao je da takav pristup mo{\v z}e razjasniti djela velikih skladatelja. Analiza mo{\v z}e tako i{\'c}i s onu stranu {\v c}isto tehni{\v c}ke analize. Da bi ilustrirao Fergusonovu teoriju, analizirao je dvije Bachove fuge, jednu s mirnim kretanjem i napeto{\v s}{\'c}u, a drugu s uzbuđuju{\'c}im kvalitetama. Fergusonova teorija mora se priznati ili odbaciti prema tome va{\v c}i li ili ne James-Langova psiholo{\v s}ka teorija. Kako je ova teorija jo{\v s} uvijek prihva{\'c}ena u modernoj psihologiji s izvjesnim modifikacijama, sada mo{\v z}emo govoriti o zajedni{\v c}kim elementima ekspresije koji istodobno pripadaju tijelu i umjetnosti glazbe.},

abstract = {Freud wrote his Psychology for Neurologists (which Strachey called A Scientific Project) in 1895. He wrote it in a feverish state within a month, yet quickly buried it. His intensity in writing it and in suppressing it has not been explained, but intriguing hints about it from Freud's correspondence with Fliess are discussed here. The work remains, however, foreshadowing many of Freud's important psychological concepts. Further, although it is often dismissed be- cause of archaic neurological ideas, many neurological guesses that Freud presented in Psychology for Neurologists are in keeping with neuroscience of today. Aspects of mechanisms of the brain, understanding dreams, developmen- tal perspectives and clinical ramifications all relate to what Freud said in this draft for a monograph.},

However, they succeed in doing so after a few days of sight. We argue that this rapid learning resembles that of adaptation to rearrangement in which the experimentally produced separations of seen and felt perceptions of objects are rapidly reunited by the process called capture. Moreover, the original ability to identify objects across modalities by the neonate may be assured by the same process.},

title = {Defense, Dreams and Rationality},
abstract = {Are some mental activities rational but unconscious? Psychopathological symptoms, it is said, have a sense -- they are seen as "compromise-formations" which express the "intentions" of agents even though the agents are totally unaware of "bringing about" such symptoms. Philosophers, who often claim that such a conception is simply contradictory or incoherent, have shed little light on the puzzles and apparent paradoxes that surround the issue. It is argued here that Freud's two models of explanation -- the mechanistic and the intentionalistic -- each fail to provide a basis for an explanatory account of the phenomenon of unconscious defense. An examination of the problem of dream "composition" helps explain why Freud's dependence upon "rational homunculi" is inappropriate and misleading. Finally, an alternative model which depends neither upon Freud's version of mechanism nor upon his lavish anthropormorphism is suggested. Ladies and Gentlemen, -- It was discovered one day that the pathological symptoms of certain neurotic patients have a sense. On this discovery the psychoanalytic method of treatment was founded. It happened in the course of the treament that patients, instead of bringing forward their symptoms, brought forward dreams. A suspicion thus arose that the dreams too had a sense.},

@article{Mills:2005p6244,

title = {A critique of relational psychoanalysis},
annote = {The scope of this article is largely preoccupied with tracing (a) the philosophical underpinnings of contemporary relational theory, (b) its theoretical relation to traditional psycho- analytic thought, (c) clinical implications for therapeutic practice, and (d) its intersection with points of consilience that emerge from these traditions.

I am afraid that the polarity between psychoanalysis as science versus psychoanalysis as hermeneutics will always be a felt tension. Disciplines that largely identify with being scientifically (and thus empirically) grounded will need to justify their theories through collaborative identification with methodologies that claim to be epistemologically objective, whereas the hermeneutic tradition is invested in their renunciation because they simply cannot buy the premise of an objective epistemology. As a result, a stalemate is unavoidable: Each side wishes to annul the validity and justifications of the other rather than seeking a complementary union or consilience. (183-4)

Following Bowman's (2002) work, I believe it is important to reiterate the point that psychoanalysis is a behavioral science and not a natural (hard) science, which conse- quently elevates the role of subjectivity, negotiation, consensus, and relational exchange when making any observation, interpretation, or epistemological assertion.

It is postulated that common sense may be categorized in three ways: (a) as a set of shared fundamental assumptions, (b) as a set of maxims or shared beliefs, and (c) as a shared way of thinking. It isfurther argued that psychology has and should have a different re- lationship with each area. The role that conceptual analysis and other research techniques can play in investigating commonsense cognitive schemata is dis- cussed. It is concluded that common sense is avaluable but inherently dangerous resource available to psychologists.},

title = {Reexamining the psychoanalytic corpse: From scientific psychology to philosophy},
abstract = {Historically, psychoanalysis has been marginalized as being pseudoscientific, incoherent, incongruent, and unverifiable and, consequently, has been marginalized from mainstream scientific psychology. Recently, Robert F. Bornstein (2001) added to this criticism by predicting the demise of psycho- analysis unless it jumps on the academic--empirical band- wagon. Throughout this article, the author challenges Born- stein's central arguments and attempts to show how philosoph- ically informed approaches to theory and method provide a viable and equally privileged alternative to substantiating psy- choanalytic thought.},
annote = {The contentious nature of my argument is not that empiricism is illegitimate, only that there are other equally privileged ways of commu- nicating and accounting for theoretical and clinical phenomena. 

given that hundreds of nonempirically oriented subfields in the humanities and the social-- behavioral sciences---relying instead on discursive, conceptual approaches to their work---are embracing psychoanalytic principles, talk of the demise of psychoanalysis seems to me to be merely the propaganda of scientific idolatry. Psychoanalysis does not need scientific psychology in order to survive and prosper; it already has. Although empirical verification may strengthen our position---itself a worthwhile aim to pursue--- psychoanalysis will nevertheless continue to flourish and justify itself through clinical efficacy, cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary applica- tion, and rigorous philosophical fortification. In this sense, psychoanalysis will never die.},

abstract = {The relevance of psychoanalysis and its place within its intellectual and cultural surround has been a major issue over the whole of its now more than a century-long history. A very significant aspect of that concern has been the status of psychoanalysis as a theory of the mind, and as a basis for the application of that theory in the conduct of a therapy for the disorders of the mind. This article reviews in depth the long-standing debate about psychoanalysis as a scientific theory, the kind of science that psychoanalysis is---or can be---and the place of research, empirical as well as conceptual (with particular focus upon research into the nature of the therapeutic change process and its desired outcomes), in the incremental growth of that theory and its therapeutic applications in an ever expanding and increasingly secure knowledge base.},

annote = {Gr{\"u}nbaum gives an overview of his critics. 
Response to Zvi Lothane. "In short, Lothane's apparent complaint that I give no credence to the etiologic role of repression, merely because we cannot see it, is just a clumsy red herring." Quite some mudfighting. 
Response to Charles Hanly. "Mirabile dictu, the eminent American psychologist, philosopher of psychology, and veteran practicing psychoanalyst Paul E. Meehl hailed my challenge to psychoanalytic causal inferences from mere thematic affinity as ``the biggest single methodological problem that we [psychoanalysts] face'' (Meehl, 1995, p. 1021)." "In the light of Meehl's commendation, I draw the important conclusion that, unless Hanly can rebut my interrelated objections to etiologic transference interpretations and to causal inferences from mere thematic affinity, his contentions against me on these counts are mere ipse dixits."
Response to W. W. Meissner, who claims "Habermas (1973) contends that the spirit of science is no longer positivist but dialogical. Psychoanalysis, in this view, would become the model for science rather than physics."
Remarks on Richard Wollheim. "Therefore, I felt entitled to expect from a philosopher like Wollheim, especially since he was a true believer in psychoanal- ysis, both an exposition and an epistemic appraisal of the highly specific therapeutic argument given there by the founding fathers for their seminal etiology. Alas, my hopes were completely dashed." And Nagel.

I review a number of Freud's passages from his seminal contributions to psychoanalytic method: Studies on Hysteria and The Interpretation of Dreams, and other writings to show that Freud himself did not make explicit another cardinal distinction: that between what he operation- ally formulated as the psychoanalytic method, procedure, or technique versus the various etiological theories of psychological, that is, emotional disorders.

"But water contaminated by sewage bacteria is hardly an appropriate metaphor for suggestion as a contaminant of the ideally pure correct interpretation, not like a pure drug versus placebo. All human spoken intercourse is contaminated since founded on suggestion and persua- sion. Anyway, what is your ideal of purity? Are your own interpretations of Freud uncontaminated by any desire to influence your audiences or readers?" (582) But this line of thought is not worked out further.},

@article{Nudds:2001p6459,
author = {Matthew Nudds}, 
journal = {Croatian Journal of Philosophy},
title = {Common-Sense and Scientific Psychology},
abstract = {In this paper I discuss the circumstances in which it would be right to revise a common-sense psychological categorisation---such as the common-sense categorisa- tion of emotions---in the light of the results of empirical investigation. I argue that an answer to that question, familiar from eliminitivist arguments, should be rejected, and suggest that the issue turns on the ontological commitments of the explanations that common-sense psychological states enter into.},
affiliation = {Birkbeck College London},
annote = {Nudds argues that it is not straightforwardly clear that scientific understanding is able to force revision of commonsense psychology. His conclusion is that this is only possible if the theory which implicitly defines our common-sense psychological terms involves explanations which contain singular terms for events and things; they could be picked out by other disciplines, and hence other theories could show that commonsense explanations are false by showing that the events of things picked out in explanations don't have the properties we supposed them to have. 
On the other hand, if the theory which implicitly defines our common-sense psychological terms involves explanations which are sentential stative explanations then they will essentially involve relations between facts. The facts which make true the explanations of one theory cannot generally be identified with the facts which make true the explanations of a different theory, because in this case commonsense psychology would not be committed to the existence of explanatory particulars.

Nudds' main argument is in support of the claim that sentential stative explanation (where the causal claim asserts a relationship between facts, and these facts are states) is excluded from inter-theoretical identification. He shows that no strategy to reformulate causal claims of sentential stative explanation in terms of singular term explanation works ({\S}5). Therefore, sentential stative explanations have no ontological commitment to certain entities. But such ontological commitment is necessary for inter-theoretical identification ({\S}2). Thus there cannot be inter-theoretical identification. So, without inter-theoretical identification of terms, there is no possible way for forced revision by other theories.

title = {What Is It Like to See with Your Ears? The Representational Theory of Mind},
abstract = {Representational theories of mind cannot individuate the sense modalities in a principled manner. According to representationalism, the phenomenal character of experiences is determined by their contents. The usual objection is that inverted qualia are possible, so the phenomenal character of experiences may vary independently of their contents. But the objection is inconclusive. It raises difficult questions about the metaphysics of secondary qualities and it is difficult to see whether or not inverted qualia are possible. This paper proposes an alternative test of representationalism. Do experiences in different sense modalities have the same phenomenal character when they share content? Psychological work on the perception of shape through vision and spatial hearing is discussed. This work shows that visual and auditory experiences differ in phenomenal character even in so far as they represent similar properties. This objection to representationalism does not invite questions about secondary qualities or depend on establishing metaphysical possibilities.},

The conception is situated within an account of animal perception and unsophisticated perceptual belief. It characterizes entitlement as fulfillment of an epistemic norm that is apriori associated with a certain representational function that can be known apriori to be a function of perception. The paper connects anti-individualism, a thesis about the nature of mental states, and perceptual entitlement. It presents an argument that explains the objectivity and validity of perceptual entitlement partly in terms of the nature of perceptual states--hence the nature of perceptual beliefs, which are constitutively associated with perceptual states. The paper discusses ways that an individual can be entitled to perceptual belief through its connection to perception, and ways that entitlement to perceptual belief can be undermined.},

Although most of the contributors to that compendium believed that they were, I suggest that a `yes' or `no' answer is not possible with regard to the corpus of Freud's ideas as a whole; each idea has to be evaluated separately. Freud's theorizing is built on two different bases: a psychological and a biological one. Not only do these eventuate in two different kinds of formula- tions throughout this theory, but sometimes even with regard to the same construct at different times in his writing. As a consequence, the assessment of the relevance of Freud's ideas for the 21st Century must be made construct by construct. A sampling of Freud's ideas about motivation, psychopathology and treatment were examined as to their contemporary relevance.},

title = {Notes for a Definition of the Concept of Psychoanalytical Epistemology},
abstract = {The first part of the article describes the epistemic ambiguities that psychoanalysis has generated through both a sometimes unstructured approach and a lack of updated epistemological information. Accordingly, a historically out-moded `scientist' model has erroneously been taken as valid and scientific. The second part illustrates the extent to which predominant psychoanalytical currents now share common ground with epistemology and the cognate sciences, breaking out of the epistemic solipsism which for too long led psycholanalysis to believe it could be self- referential. This critical examination of old and new ground is thus an analysis of the referents on which psychoanalysis has based its theoretical postulates. It is desirable that this analysis be extended to include the whole discipline of psychoanalytical research, thereby becoming a mental given for the psychoanalyst, not least on account of the enormous benefit of epistemic reflexion on the adoption of the instruments of knowledge. Over the last few years this development has allowed psychoanalytical theory to be considered on a par with the results of philosophy and the philosophy of science, thereby ending the false and anti-scientific aristocracy of thought which made psychoanalysis a prisoner of itself for almost a century.},
annote = {This critical examination of old and new ground is thus an analysis of the referents on which psychoanalysis has based its theoretical postulates.
Focus on importance of intersubjectivity and social models. "Considerable changes have been brought about by the fact that psycho- analysis has absorbed the socio-psychological, philosophical, and epistemic concept of distrib- uted sociality, together with those of a non- foundationist but relativist epistemology. In the first case, for example, the explorations of epistemic philosophy have meant that it is no longer feasible to speak of transference and countertransference, but of two transferences: that of the patient and that of the analyst, in relation to an intersubjective system of mutual and reciprocal influence (141).

Even if there is no explicit epistemology in the Freudian writings, it is undeniable that the genesis of psychoanalysis has a rigorous dialetic between theorization and clinical observation. Metapsychology is an organized and consistent set of concepts, capable of explaining and coordinating the analytical experience. It is through metapsychology that clinical work encounters the possibility of universalization, while metapsychology finds the possibility of fulfillment in clinical work. Clinical experience also confirms the interrelation between psychopathology and culture. Modern times have brought about new versions for psychopathological symptoms, which, in turn, have special effects on the narcisistic personalities and the manifestations of anxiety, giving place to different neurotic configurations.},

@article{Meissner:2006p6260,

journal = {Psychoanalytic Psychology},
title = {Prospects for Psychoanalysis in the 21st century},
abstract = {This article is responding to the question: what is it that will enrich and sustain the discipline of psychoanalysis during the remainder of the twenty-first century. I argue that continued vitality requires that analysis demonstrate its value and utility in relation to other psychologically relevant fields of human inquiry. Analysis cannot afford to remain isolated within the private confines of the analytic consulting room, but it must also dare to cast its lot with the uncer- tainties of ongoing research and understanding arising in other related fields. I begin analysis of these problems by discussing first some organizational issues that might facilitate such collaboration and communication, and then some issues related to interdisciplinary collaborative research. I focus particularly on questions related to the dialogue between psychoanalysis and religious thought and between psychoanalysis and neuroscience. These are only two among a multiplicity of fields in which interdisciplinary opportunities arise, but they exemplify the basic challenges to continued psychoanalytic progress and inno- vation. I finish with some thoughts about the diversity of analytic theoretical conceptualizations and their implications for facilitating or inhibiting such interdisciplinary efforts.},

title = {Psychotherapy's Philosophical Values: Insight or Absorption?},
abstract = {According to insight-oriented psychotherapies, the change clients undergo during therapy results from insights gained into the "true" nature of the self, which entail greater self-knowledge and self-understanding. In this paper, I question such claims through a critical examination of the epistemological and metaphysical values underlying such forms of therapy. I claim that such psychotherapeutic practices are engaged in a process that subtly "absorbs" clients into the therapist's philosophical framework which is characterized by a certain problematic conception of subjectivity, knowledge, and reality. Through mechanisms which are intrinsic to the therapeutic encounter, such as suggestion and power, such therapies construct and reconfigure clients along the lines of socially accepted norms and values. Consequently, insight-oriented psychotherapy results in a deceptive form of social control.},

Starting from an elaborate critique of the identity theory, Sellars claims that the ultimate 'Scientific Image' must contain a concept of sensa as the bearers of certain properties of manifest sense impressions. In his later work Sellars' notion of absolute processes leads him to a new monism and thus to an extended critique of rival theories. It is argued that these Sellarsian thoughts can be helpful in the actual discussion of the mind-body-problem.},

title = {The evolution of the practice of the psychoanalytic psychotherapies},
abstract = {When Freud began his professional career, psychotherapy was already an established practice, standing upon the theory of ideogenesis, according to which certain motor symptoms were caused by ideas. This theory offered the rational ground for psychotherapy: if a symptom was provoked by an idea, it was possible to undo it by finding and erasing this very idea. Freud developed this theory into the model of unconscious ideas and into the technique of ``interpreting the contents''. Whereas the later discoveries of resistance, transference, and character structure, should have promoted a break with the ideogenetic model, Freud never gave up the erroneous assumption that behind an action there was an idea, which had to be captured if one wanted to stop the action. This assumption was questioned again and again during the interminable controversy over the relative importance of remembering and experiencing: by Ferenczi and Rank in the Twenties, Alexander in the Fifties, and Gill in the Eighties, when they tried to shift the focus from remembering to experiencing, in order to make psychoanalysis an effective psychotherapy. Today, the view that what organizes our actions is stored in the form of ``ideas'' is no longer accepted by the scientific community. Instead, we speak of ``operative models'' and implicit or procedural memories.},
annote = {But are we sure that the reason for our actions, i.e. what organizes our actions, is stored in the form of ``ideas'', and that our mind is a sort of box full of these ideas? Today, the scientific community no longer accepts this view and its implications. Instead of ``ideas'' one prefers to speak of ``operative models'' and privileges the notions of implicit or procedural memories. In the field of psychoanalysis this turn is reflected by the contemporary success of the term ``enactment'', which adequately represents the sunset of the classic ideogenetic view as applied to transference, i.e. of the view that repetition is caused by a memory.},

title = {Memory, Distortion, and History in the Museum},
abstract = {Museums are conventionally viewed as institutions dedicated to the conservation of valued objects and the education of the public. Recently, controversies have arisen regarding the representation of history in museums. National museums in America and Germany considered here, such as the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, the Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the German Historical Museum, have become sites of contention where national histories and personal memories are often at odds. Contemporary art installations in museums which take historical consciousness as their theme similarly raise contentious issues about public knowledge of and personal interest in the past. When members of publics find that their memories of the past or their expectations for museum experiences are not being met, a kind of "distortion" occurs. The "distortion" related to memory and history in the museum is not so much of facts or interpretations, but rather a distortion from the lack of congruity between personal experience and expectation, on the one hand, and the institutional representation of the past on the other. This essay explores the possibilities for a redefined relationship between personal memory and history that is experienced in contemporary museums.},

journal = {Psychoanalytic Psychology},
title = {Freud's Legacy---Is it Still with us?},
abstract = {Unconscious processes of mind are a fact of life, both as phenomenon and as explanatory concept and were recognized before Freud. But it was Freud who not only put ``the unconscious'' on the map but also operationalized it in a new way---as a dynamic unconscious, laying down the foundation of a science of the unconscious, his Copernican revolution. The new science first provided a dual purpose method: investigating the emotional and ideational manifestations of disordered human behavior and psychological conflict and healing those disor- ders. In becoming a general psychoanalytic psychology, it played an important role in unraveling the dynamics of sexuality in the individual and society, literature and the arts, and in group dynamics in peace and war.

annote = {The author emphasizes hitherto unacknowledged aspects: (1) The distinction between a theory of method and a theory of disorder; and (2) The role of interpersonal, or dyadic, dynamics in Freud's method, completing the largely monadic or intrapersonal focus in Freud.

Mainly sketches development of Freud's work. Focus on interpersonal aspects of transference relation. Difference between therapeutical and general theoretical aspects of psychoanalysis.

"Here is the rub! The theory of psychological conflict, memories, dreams, and the theory of instinctual sexual drives do not exist on the same plane; they are different sorts of theory: The former is operational, the latter is hypothetical. "(295)

Discussion of Gr{\"u}nbaum at 298. "If the personal relationship between doctor and patient be classed as a placebo effect, then one cannot deny the role it plays in psychiatry, for the effect of administering true drugs cannot be disentangled from the allegedly ``phony'' admixture of placebo, certainly, not where compliance with the prescribed drug regimens is concerned. Freud was acutely aware of such contamination and was not Gru ̈nbaum's fool: He knew about the influence of transference, resistance, and falsification of memories." Not worked out into an argument.},

title = {Seismicity crisis at the Katla volcano, Iceland - signs of a cryptodome?},
abstract = {Katla, one of the most active and hazardous Icelandic volcanoes, has shown signs of unrest since 1999. In July that year a small glacial flood lasting a few hours was observed, accompanied by abnormal seismicity. It was probably caused by a short-lived, shallow magma intrusion or possibly a small subglacial eruption. In 2002 seismic activity increased dramatically, particularly in the Gooabunaa area west of the caldera, and earthquakes have occurred continuously ever since. A network of four portable seismometers was run at Katla in the spring-summer 2003, with one station directly at the locus of the Gooabunga activity. These observations are combined with the data of the permanent Icelandic digital seismograph network, run by the Icelandic Meteorological Office. The earthquakes at Gooabunga are concentrated in a small area with a diameter of 3 to 4 km, and the events are shallow, mainly within the uppermost 2 km. We propose that the unusual pattern of seismicity indicates an intruding hot and acidic cryptodome. Apparently this dome has been slowly rising for decades but its propagation towards the surface accelerated some time around 1999, possibly triggered by a basaltic intrusion. This may lead to a silicic dome-building eruption in the Gooabunga area. which should be taken into consideration when estimating the eruption hazard at Katla. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In what follows, I discuss some of the central questions. The questions to be discussed are: how general is parthood? Are there different kinds of parthood or ways to be a part? Can two things be composed of the same parts? When does composition occur? Can material objects gain or lose parts? What is the logical form of the parthood relation enjoyed by material objects?},

title = {The knowledge-structureand inductiviststrategies in causal attribution: A direct comparison},
abstract = {Two different strategies f o r making causal attributions are distinguished. Thefirst is the classic inductivist approach, which uses covariation information to arrive at causal attributions. The second is the knowledge-structure approach, which uses information relevant to knowledge about plans and goals to explain behaviour. Two experiments are reported in which information activating both types of strategy is given. The results indicate that goal-relevant information activates expectancies that resist the presence of explicit covariation information. The results are interpreted as indicating that expectancies generated by knowledge-structures are therefore different to those activated by verbs, which do not resist the effect of explicit covariation information. It is concluded that knowledge-structures constitute an alternative strategy of causal attribution to the inductivist strategy, and the nature of the relationship between the two strategies is considered.},

Unlike the views advanced by the classical state-of-nature models of Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau, object relations perceives humans in their original state as already grouped and driven by an urge to associate. Company (rather than privacy, property, or political participation) stands out as the basic right, and all the other rights follow on it as instruments for fulfilling it. The primacy of care lends itself to the justification of distributive measures meant to bolster family cohesion and individual confidence at the expense of the open market. The theory is therefore compatible with the premises of the social-democratic welfare state.},

abstract = {Sellars is well known for his critique of the "myth of the given" in his "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". That text does not make it unambiguous just how he understands the "myth". Here I take it that whatever else may be involved, his critique is incompatible with the view that there is a nonconceptual mode of "presentation" or "givenness" of particulars that is the heart of sense perception and what is most distinctive of perception as a type of cognition. A critical examination of Sellars' arguments, particularly those directed at the Theory of Appearing, results in the conclusion that he has failed to eliminate the above view of perception. Moreover, though Sellars is clearly opposed to the view that perceptual experience cannot provide justification for beliefs about perceived objects, I argue that Sellars has failed to shake the intuitive plausibility of that view.},

abstract = {Hermeneutic and anti-hermeneutic sides in the debate about psychoanalysis are entangled in an epistemological and methodological antinomy, here exemplified by Gr{\"u}nbaum's and Spence's paradigmatic views. Both contain a partial element of truth, which they assert dialectically one against the other ({\S}{\S} 1 and 2). This antinomy disappers only by reconciling an operationalist approach with man's ability to suspend the effectiveness of the 'laws' applied to him ({\S} 3). The hermeneutic way in which the technical-operational criterion of truth works in psychoanalysis demands that clinical and extra-clinical testing methods work synergically, through a fruitful self-correcting strategy, grounded on the very psychoanalytic object: the unconscious ({\S} 4).},

Illustrative examples discussed include the ``widening scope'' of the use of ``parameters'' in psychoanalytic treatment; the rejection of the ``Enlightenment Vision'' and the concomitant de-emphasis on the role of insight; the concept of ``narrative truth''; and the ``totalistic'' re- conceptualization of the meaning of countertransferase. I then discuss the relationship between research and clinical practice and argue that if it is to grow, psychoanalysis must be open to and attempt to integrate findings from other related disciplines.},

title = {A perspective on judgment and choice: Mapping bounded rationality},
abstract = {Early studies of intuitive judgment and decision making conducted with the late Amos Tversky are reviewed in the context of two related concepts: an analysis of accessibil- ity, the ease with which thoughts come to mind; a distinc- tion between effortless intuition and deliberate reasoning. Intuitive thoughts, like percepts, are highly accessible. De- terminants and consequences of accessibility help explain the central results of prospect theory, framing effects, the heuristic process of attribute substitution, and the charac- teristic biases that result from the substitution of nonexten- sional for extensional attributes. Variations in the accessi- bility of rules explain the occasional corrections of intuitive judgments. The study of biases is compatible with a view of intuitive thinking and decision making as generally skilled and successful.},

abstract = {Psychoanalysis started out as a unitary theory to encompass disparate observ- able phenomena. Symptoms, dreams, character traits, psychopathology, and normal psychology all rested on the same explanatory intrapsychic base. Since then, theory has grown by accretion and by the creation of alternative theoretical systems. Various fallacies and flaws in logic have played a part in this devel- opment. The current state of pluralism, in my view, has resulted in a theoretical fragmentation that reduced the power and inspiration intrinsic to a unified, coherent psychoanalytic theory. I describe a total composite unitary theory, cumulative over the century, in which all valid and enduring elements of competitive psychoanalytic theories are included.},
annote = {Developments. What does PA has to encompass? Various approaches are discussed, incl. enactive and intersubjective. "psychoanalysis is emphasized as a 2-person psychology, or a social-constructivist relationship, highlighting the equality of patient and analyst as though the assumption of the analyst and patient roles in treatment assumes the same asymmetric position in life. Countertransference is placed on a par with transference and, with some analysts, is considered the means of treatment. This is akin to an analyst who said at a panel, ``I don't like resistances,'' feeling that to point out a resistance or defense is an insult or put-down of the patient."},

At crucial points the arguments confuse the perspectives of a knower and those attributing knowledge to a knower. Only one argument-the "inconsistent triad" argument-addresses the Myth of the Given as such, and there are several ways of escaping its conclusion. Invocations of Sellars's refutation of the Myth of the Given are empty.},

This article considers the latter question with particular focus on the distinction between images and graphs on the one hand and descriptions and related representations on the other.},

title = {The blindsight saga},
abstract = {Blindsight is the ability of patients with clinically blind field defects, caused by damage to the primary visual cortex V, to detect, localise and even discriminate visual stimuli that they deny seeing. Blindsight tells us much about the nature of visual processing in the absence of the primary visual cortex and is a paradigmatic example of implicit knowledge. It has attracted widespread interest and debate amongst philosophers, cognitive neuropsychologists and visual neuroscientists. Its downside is that possible artefacts abound, much more so than with examples of implicit memory or deaf hearing and numb touch. Unfortunately the artefacts are still frequently ignored, or dismissed as captious, with the result that many of the genuine qualities of blindsight remain uncertain. Now that blindsight in monkeys has been established the substantial literature on the effects of removing parts or all of V1 in monkeys on the residual physiological cerebral responses to visual stimuli in their field defects is at last directly relevant to human blindsight. Whether blindsight is, or could be, useful in everyday life is the next unsolved problem.},

title = {Space and Sight},
abstract = {This paper, which has both a historical and a polemical aspect, investigates the view, dominant throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, that the sense of sight is, originally, not phenomenally three-dimensional in character, and that we must come to interpret its properly two-dimensional data by reference to the sense of "touch". The principal argument for this claim, due to Berkeley, is examined and found wanting. The supposedly confirming findings concerning "Molyneux subjects" are also investigated and are shown to be either irrelevant or disconfirming. Recent investigations on infant and neonatal perception are discussed and are also found to be disconfirming. An innatist version of the theory is then considered and is shown to be undermined by the largely "Gibsonian" character of early space-perception. Finally three recent arguments in favour of the theory-two from psychologists, one from a philosopher-are considered and answered},

In both studies, relevant symptoms were rated as more severe when illness group memberships were salient.

title = {The relationship between object files and conscious perception},
abstract = {Object files (OFs) are hypothesized mid-level representations which mediate our conscious perception of persisting objects-e.g. telling us 'which went where'. Despite the appeal of the OF framework, not previous research has directly explored whether OFs do indeed correspond to conscious percepts. Here we present at least one case wherein conscious percepts of 'which went where' in dynamic ambiguous displays diverge from the analogous correspondence computed by the OF system. Observers viewed a 'bouncing/streaming' display in which two identical objects moved such that they could have either bounced off or streamed past each other. We measured two dependent variables: (1) an explicit report of perceived bouncing or streaming; and (2) an implicit 'object-specific preview benefit' (OSPB), wherein a 'preview' of information on a specific object speeds the recognition of that information at a later point when it appears again on the same object (compared to when it reappears on a different object), beyond display-wide priming. When the displays were manipulated such that observers had a strong bias to perceive streaming (on over 95% of the trials), there was nevertheless a strong OSPB in the opposite direction-such that the object files appeared to have 'bounced' even though the percept 'streamed'. Given that OSPBs have been taken as a hallmark of the operation of object files, the five experiments reported here suggest that in at least some specialized (and perhaps ecologically invalid) cases, conscious percepts of 'which went where' in dynamic ambiguous displays can diverge from the mapping computed by the object-file system.},

It is suggested that such naive hypotheses are tentatively advanced as explanations for the behavior, may serve as an attribution of the crudest type, and provide the perceiver with a simplifying heuristic for the acquisition and use of further information. Information search and processing is described as following a principle of cognitive economy: The perceiver attempts to confirm the naively held hypothesis rather than discon- firm alternative hypotheses and uses information allowing for simple-covariation---rather than complex---augmentation and discounting schemes. Five experiments are offered in support of this view.},

annote = {On the non-semantic view of computation, a computational explanation of a person's coming to be in an intentional state involves one non- semantic state explaining, by some computational procedure, a second non-semantic state. This second state is said to be the basis of (or realization of, or what constitutes) the intentional state to be explained. But if only non-semantic properties are explained, where is the explanation of the intentional properties? It seems that on the non-semantic conception of computation, only non-semantic features of intentional states could be explained.},
